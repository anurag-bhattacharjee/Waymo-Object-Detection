# Waymo-Object-Detection
Autonomous vehicles and human-robot teams are two very forward-looking topics that have potential for positive impact by introducing sustainable methods of transportation .Google launched its Waymo division to develop and market consumer-ready driverless vehicles around the globe. The objective of autonomous vehicles along with Waymo is to provide convenience, cost & safety to make them ubiquitous and indispensable.This project involves investigating the open dataset recently released by Waymo (https://waymo.com/open/). This data contains both camera images as well as point-cloud data generated by LIDAR. This deals with specifically extracting and characterizing all objects' interactions with, or nearby, autonomous vehicles. This will include identifying appropriate car- live object interactions, labeling them, and attempting to provide insights that can further identify and label relevant data autonomously (through a machine learning classifier).
